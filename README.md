# Fragile

Fragile is a browser-based puzzle game built by Brian Burchett and Steve Eckles. It was created using JavaScript combined with HTML and CSS using the Document Object Model.

It was created as our final project for the first semester of the CSET program at Thaddeus Stevens. The project was planned and implemented using the Agile process and a centralized Git workflow.

## To Play:
Fork or clone the repo and open the index.html file in your browser, or simply navigate to https://steve-d-eckles.github.io/Fragile/.

Click the start button and follow the on-screen instructions to navigate to the puzzles, solve them, and complete the game. The game is played entirely using the mouse.

(If you have trouble playing the drain minigame for any reason (it's tough!), you can press 'C' on your keyboard to cheat. Just a little reward for checking the readme! We, of course, encourage you to challenge yourself and beat it legit.)
